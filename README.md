## Aim
To build a machine learning model that accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or ham (non-spam).

## Libraries
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- nltk
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Data Set
We use the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SMS+Spam+Collection), which contains 5,574 SMS messages labeled as ham or spam.

## Pre-process
1. Load the dataset.
2. Clean and preprocess the text data (e.g., removing punctuation, stop words).
3. Convert text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF.

## Model Training
1. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. Train various models (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
3. Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Visualization
- Plot confusion matrices to visualize model performance.
- Use ROC curves to assess the trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
